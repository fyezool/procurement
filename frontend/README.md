# Procurement System - Frontend

This directory contains the Flutter web frontend for the Procurement System.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have the Flutter SDK installed. If you don't have it, you can follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- The backend server must be running. Please follow the instructions in the `backend/README.md` to start it. The frontend expects the backend to be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Setup & Running the App

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the web app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
    This will start the application in a Chrome browser window.
